Ncurses
=======


.. glossary::

    Description
        An API for writing text-based user interfaces

    Rationale
        The packaging of ncurses for the final system requires utilities that ship with ncurses, so it has a self-dependency




The following script [#f1]_ outlines the commands required to complete this step:

.. literalinclude:: mere_temptools_scripts/013-ncurses.sh
    :language: bash


.. [#f1] :download:`013-ncurses.sh <mere_temptools_scripts/013-ncurses.sh>`
