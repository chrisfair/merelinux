LightCube OS aims to be a lightweight, server-centric Linux distribution
with the main goals of performance and stability.

The original (development) versions of LightCube OS used glibc (as well
as a number of other core GNU utilities) and rpm for package management. The
spec files for these have been moved into the glibc branch.

In the interest of avoiding bloat and boosting performance, future versions
will be based on musl libc and the pacman package manager, and the master
branch has been prepped to receive these modifications. In addition, at
least for now, most GNU utilities have been replaced with busybox which
further reduces size and boosts performance.
