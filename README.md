# Mere Linux
Mere Linux is a simple Linux distribution built upon [musl](http://www.musl-libc.org/) libc and aimed at virtualized or containerized server instances.

## Why Another Distribution?
Mainstream Linux distributions tend to be a marriage of two main use cases:
* A long-lived Web/Internet server, running on physical hardware, supporting many users, often managed directly
* Full-blown desktop systems

As cloud infrastructure continues to gain popularity, such distributions have often been made to work inside virtual machines and containers, although they havenâ€™t really been designed for that purpose.

What if support for the above use cases were stripped away? What if a distribution was designed to be run in a virtual machine or container, where:
* Scalability and flexibility are more important than traditional conventions
* It is understood that administration is not best done individually and directly
* Metrics and logs are intended to be collected and exported externally
* Deployment and configuration happens through instance creation and deletion

What would a distribution optimized for such a use case look like?

Mere Linux aims to find the answer.
