Workflow
========

.. note::

   This is a placeholder for future documentation. Eventually, this should
   provide guidance on collaborative development as well as testing and
   publishing packages.

   For now, the shell scripts located in the `scripts` directory, and the many
   example PKGBUILD files in `packages` provide working examples of usage.
